You need to implement the following tasks: 
1. Write a method to iterate through all elements in an ArrayList containing the days of the week (strings). The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
2. Write a method to insert a string "MJC" into the ArrayList at the third (counting from 1) and last positions. The ArrayList should initially contain "String1", "String2", "String3". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list, separated by a space.
3. Write a method to copy one ArrayList into another (copy list2 into list1). The first List should contain "1", "2", "3", "4". The second List should contain "A", "B", "C", "D". The method should return a string containing the elements of the list1, separated by a space.
4. Write a method to iterate a LinkedList containing the days of the week (strings) in reverse order. The method should return a string containing the elements of the list in reverse order, separated by a space.
5. Write a method that adds 1 000 000 elements to ArrayList and LinkedList then gets a random element from the filled lists by index 1 000 times. Measure the time spent. Compare the results and return 1 if the time spent for ArrayList is greater, -1 if less, 0 if equal.
